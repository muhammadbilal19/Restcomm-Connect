This week we will present a new Restcomm application example targeting the automotive industry. The fully functional application is available for trial and download.

*ABCauto* is a car repair business and the manager wants a solution that will help him manage customer’s appointments. He has this list of requirements

* He would like customers to be able to make appointments 24/7 even after closing hours.
* He would like his customers to receive a confirmation SMS after they make an appointment.
* He would also like customers to be able to check their current appointment any time of the day.
* He would like a web page where he could see current appointments.
* The manager of ABCauto will also like to update car repair status using a telephone system.

Telestax offered ABCauto a solution powered by Restcomm Connect using the Visual Designer as a great way to quickly accelerate building an IVR application. Since, Restcomm can integrate with other Service Providers, the solution will allow SMS through the Voip Innovations network.

= Application features

* menu 1 - make new appointment
* menu 2 - check car status
* menu 3 - Admin for ABCauto owner to update car status and set cost of repair. At the end of this, an SMS will be sent to the customer, stating car has been repaired and the cost of repair. Menu 3 is password protected with password set to (1234)

= Requirements

* - knowledge of Restcomm
* - knowledge of PHP and MySQL
* - knowledge of JSON

NOTE: In order to set up the application you need to register SMS enabled DID from your service provider like Voip Innovations

You also need to add the Restcomm.xml configuration section that allows you to send SMS (with voip innovations IP)

        <!-- The SMS aggregator is responsible for the handling of SMS messages
                             inside of RestComm. Refer to the org.mobicents.servlet.sip.restcomm.SmsAggregator
                                             interface for more information. -->
        <sms-aggregator class="SmsService">
                        <outbound-prefix>#</outbound-prefix>
                        <outbound-endpoint>64.136.174.30</outbound-endpoint>
       </sms-aggregator>
----

= Step 1

* Log into your Restcomm Admin UI
* Create new project
* Create modules as follows: 

** Welcome
** getAvailableDay
** chooseDay
** enterPhone
** validateApp
** confirmationApp
** getCarBrand
** chooseCarBrand
** CarStatus
** StatusAndCost
** CarStatusConfirm
** AdminGetPwd
** AdminCheckPwd
** AdminGetPhone
** AdminGetStatusCode
** AdminSetCost
** AdminStatusUpdate
** AdminSendSMS

image:./images/AllModules.jpg[AllModules,width=853,height=155]

= Step 2

* Enter your phpMyAdmin
* Create new database
* Create the following MySQL tables:

*Appointment*

image:./images/mysqlapp.jpg[mysqlapp,width=585,height=150]

////

== Calendar

**calendar; fields: numbers, days; Days** and their numbers should be inserted here. Use Insert button in order to add records in the table. The result after all records being added should be:

 ./images/sqldays.jpg[image:./images/sqldays.jpg[sqldays,width=621,height=122]] ./images/sqldays2.jpg[image:./images/sqldays2.jpg[sqldays2,width=307,height=169]] [/av_tab] [av_tab title='carstatus' icon_select='no' icon=''] *carstatus; fields: telephone, car_brand, carStatus, cost* ./images/sqlcarstatus.jpg[image:./images/sqlcarstatus.jpg[sqlcarstatus,width=635,height=103]] [/av_tab] [av_tab title='car_brand' icon_select='no' icon=''] *car_brand; fields: number, brand_name* Car brands and numbers should be inserted in the table. Use again Insert button to add records in the table. The result should be similar to: ./images/sqlcarbrand.jpg[image:./images/sqlcarbrand.jpg[sqlcarbrand,width=674,height=139]] ./images/sqlcarbrand2.jpg[image:./images/sqlcarbrand2.jpg[sqlcarbrand2,width=323,height=157]] [/av_tab] [av_tab title='status_list' icon_select='no' icon=''] *status_list; fields: number, status_list* In this table add status for number 1 - "Repaired" and for 2 - "Welcome back, ABC auto has not yet updated the status for". ./images/sqlstatuslist.jpg[image:./images/sqlstatuslist.jpg[sqlstatuslist,width=682,height=141]] ./images/sqlstatuslist2.jpg[image:./images/sqlstatuslist2.jpg[sqlstatuslist2,width=462,height=135]] [/av_tab] [/av_tab_container]

You will need the following PHP scripts in order to make the application work.

* Add two URL parameters: - app_phone with $app_phone value;
* Add assignment: - car_status , choose module as scope. Add car_status as value.
* Continue to CarStatusConfirm module.

image:./images/statusandcost.jpg[statusandcost,width=756,height=436]

= Step 13

* Go to CarStatusConfirm module
* Add Say. Type the following in the text area: "$car_status Thank you for calling ABC Auto Repair". Customer will hear car status for his number and the cost for the service.
* Type following in SMS Text area: “$car_status Thank you for calling ABC Auto Repair.”. This message will include the telephone entered by the customer, the status of the car for that number and the cost for the service.
* In order to receive sms to the number you are calling from you need to use $core_From variable. Type it in To are
* Type the number from which you want to send SMS in From area.
* In Continue to you can set next module to which you want the application to proceed. In this application there isn't continue to module.
* Status callback takes a URL as an argument. When the SMS message is actually sent, or if sending fails, RestComm will make an asynchronous POST request to this URL with the parameters ‘SmsStatus’ and ‘SmsSid’. Note, ‘statusCallback’ always uses HTTP POST to request the given url. You can leave the field blank if you don’t need it.

image:./images/carstatusconfirm.jpg[carstatusconfirm,width=744,height=426]

* Add admin_Pwd as URL parameter
* Choose routing decision to be dynamic and to continue to confirm_pwd value

image:./images/AdminCheckPwd.jpg[AdminCheckPwd,width=813,height=425]

If the password is correct the application will proceed to AdminGetPhone module. If it is not it will proceed to AdminWrongPwd.

= Step 16

* Go to AdminWrongPwd module
* Add Collect
* Add Say in Collect prompt. Type: "You entered an invalid password, press 1 to try again or you may hang up" in the text area.
* Choose to create a menu.
* Set AdmingGetPwd as digit 1 target.

image:./images/adminwrongpwd.jpg[adminwrongpwd,width=746,height=399]

* Add three URL parameters: 
** admin_Phone, $admin_Phone value
** admin_Repair_Code, $admin_Repair_Code value
** admin_Repair_Cost, $admin_Repair_Cost value
* Assign to admin_result_cost. Choose module as a scope. Add car_cost value from the right side.
* Continue to AdminSendSMS

image:./images/adminstatusupdate.jpg[adminstatusupdate,width=834,height=470]

= Step 21

* Go to AdminSendSMS module

* Leave Continue to and Status callback empty.

image:./images/adminsendsms1.jpg[adminsendsms,width=778,height=437]

And the application is ready to be tested.

= Step 22

This step is showing how to easily cancel appointments using simple PHP scripts.     

Firstly create **listRemoveAppointment.php**. The script includes simple HTML table showing list of all of the appointments. All of the records from appointments table are being selected. Then calendar and car_brand tables are being joined to appointments so that script can get needed information (telephone, brand_name, days). Cancel button runs *validateCancelAppointment.php.*  

*listRemoveAppointment.php*
