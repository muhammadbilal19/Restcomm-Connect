In this tutorial, you will learn how to send an SMS from Restcomm Visual Designer (RVD) to a Jitsi SIP phone.  

= Requirements

* Restcomm on running on your local server.
* Jitsi SIP phone installed on your local server. (Latest version of Jitsi)

= Step 1

Create an SMS application using RVD

* Go to http://127.0.0.1:8080/restcomm-rvd on your web browser
* In the *Start New Project* page, choose *Voice*
* Create a new project RVD project. In this tutorial the project name is SMSTest and press the button Create

Next, create two new modules.called Welcome and Send SMS

* Remove the default Say verb
* Drag and drop the *Dial* Verb into the Welcome module.
* Drag and drop the *Client* noun to the space below the noun list and enter the name *alice*
* You must create the *Send SMS* module in order to be able to select it in the *Continue to* drop down list.
* The *Welcome* module should be similar to the screenshot below.

Next, you need to create the *Send SMS* module

* Drag and drop the *SMS* button on the left hand pane into the new module you have just created
* Type the SMS message you will like to send in the text area of the *Say* verb.
* Enter alice in the *To* field
* Enter any number in the *From* field
* Leave the rest of the field as default
* The *Send SMS* module should look like the screen below
* Save the project by pressing the *Save* button at the top of the page

= Step 2

You must now link the newly created SMSTest to a Restcomm phone number.

* Go to http://127.0.0.1:8080/ in order to open the Restcomm Admin Management page
* You will see the login, screen below. Log in using your credentials.

In the main dashboard, click on the menu *Numbers* to reveal a list of already configured phone numbers and the application to which they are linked.

* Next, click on the *+Register Number* button

image:./images/restcomm-rvd-smstest5.png[restcomm-rvd-smstest5,width=687,height=284]

In the *Register Number* window, enter a new phone number you will like to attach to your SMSTest application. In this tutorial *7777* is the number chosen. 

Click on the Optional Parameters to reveal more configuration options 

In the Voice section under **Voice Request URL**, click the option button at the end to reveal available RVD projects.

Select SMSTest and at the end of the window, press the *Register* button to confirm your configuration.

The number *7777* will now appear in the list of registered numbers.   

= Step 3

In this section, you will configure Jitsi SIP phone to use the Restcomm application you have just created and receive the SMS message you configured.

* Start two instances of jitsi from the command line.
* The first instance can be started by typing *jitsi*
* Second instance *jitsi - -multiple*

Configure instance with alice account

* Click on the menu Tools ->Options
* Click on the Add button at the bottom of the window
* In the Network, select SIP
* SIP id = alice
* Password = 1234
* Click on the *Advanced* button

In the Account Registration Wizard, go to the Connection tab

* Enter *127.0.0.1* as the Registrar IP address and leave the port as default

In the section Proxy Options, uncheck the Configure proxy automatically and enter the following:

* Proxy = *127.0.0.1*
* Port = *5080*

image:./images/restcomm-rvd-smstest8a.png[restcomm-rvd-smstest8a,width=711,height=548]

* At the bottom of the window, press **Next**, then, *Sign in*
* You should now see that *alice* is registered when you set the account to online.

Next step is to configure the second instance with user Bob. The configuration is similar to the one used for Alice. 

= Step 4

WARNING: Alice configuration SIP port must match the port configured in the restcomm.xml file to which the SMS message will be sent

How to check: In the Jitsi instance on which user Alice is configured,

* Click on the menu *Tools -> Options*
* Click on the tab **Advanced**, on the left pane, select *SIP*
* That will show the screen below:

image:./images/restcomm-rvd-smstest10.png[restcomm-rvd-smstest10,width=515,height=422]

Make sure the *SIP client port* above (**5070**)matches the port defined in the `$RESTCOMM_HOME/standalone/deployments/restcomm.war/WEB-INF/conf/restcomm.xml`

[source,lang:xml,decode:true]
----
<sms-aggregator class="SmsService">
	<outbound-prefix></outbound-prefix> 
	<outbound-endpoint>127.0.0.1:**5070**</outbound-endpoint> 
</sms-aggregator>   
----

= Step 5

You can now make a call from Bob to Alice. From the Jitsi SIP phone on which Bob is registered. make a call to **7777**, the number attached to the SMSTest application. 

See screenshot below   

image:./images/restcomm-rvd-smstest11.png[restcomm-rvd-smstest11,width=250,height=395]

The Jitsi phone to which Alice is connected will ring. 

Answer the call and then hang up. The SMS message you entered in the *Send SMS* module of the RVD will appear in a pop-up window similar to the one below. Note that the number 55555 appears as the source of the SMS message.
