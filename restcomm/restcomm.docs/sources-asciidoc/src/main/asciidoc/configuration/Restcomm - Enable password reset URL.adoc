Restcomm does not provide built-in support for resetting the password of an account.
A seperate external service should be provided for this. However, if such
a service exists, __Dashboard__ can be configured to redirect the user
to this service through a 'Forgot password ?' prompt.

In order to enable the 'Forgot password ?' prompt:

* Edit dashboard configuration file located here:

  {RESTCOMM_HOME}/standalone/deployments/restcomm-management.war/conf/dashboard.json

* Set `resetPasswordUrl` property to the *absolute* url of the actual
  password reset service. For example:

  {
      "resetPasswordUrl": "http://restcomm.aux/resetPassword"
  }

Once set, a 'Forgot password ?' link will be displayed under the login form
of Dashboard. When the user clicks on it a new browser tab will open
at the location specified in the url.
