The configuration guide will show you how to create a keystore and activate SSL for HTTPS connection.


[[enable-https-secure-connector]]
Enable HTTPs Secure Connector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, Restcomm uses port 8080 for HTTP connector. The following instruction will guide you through the steps required to configure SSL and enable HTTPS.

Make sure you are testing using the latest Restcomm. 


[[step-1]]
Step 1 - Keystore by Certificate Authority (CA)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you will be using a self-signed certificate, you may skip the step and go to Step 2

If you are using a Certificate Authority (CA), create the keystore as instructed by the CA provider and copy the keystore to $RESTCOMM_HOME/standalone/configuration/ directory. 
Next, go to step 3.

Here is a link for a free Certificate Authority (CA). https://letsencrypt.org/


[[step-2]]
Step 2 - Self-signed Certificate Keystore
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 


To create a self-signed certificate keystore, perform the following steps:

[source,lang:default,decode:true]
----
$JAVA_HOME/bin/keytool -genkey -alias restcomm -keyalg RSA -keystoreÂ  restcomm.jks
----

For this example, we shall use the password, "changeit". 

Also make sure that for first and last name (CN) you provide the hostname of the machine running Restcomm. Running the command should look like this:

[source,lang:default,decode:true]
----
Enter keystore password: changeit
Re-enter new password: changeit
What is your first and last name?
[Unknown]: HOSTNAME_HERE
What is the name of your organizational unit?
[Unknown]:
What is the name of your organization?
[Unknown]:
What is the name of your City or Locality?
[Unknown]:
What is the name of your State or Province?
[Unknown]:
What is the two-letter country code for this unit?
[Unknown]:
Is CN=HOSTNAME_HERE, OU=Unknown, O=Unknown, L=Unknown, ST=Unknown, C=Unknown correct?
[no]: yes

Enter key password for <restcomm>
(RETURN if same as keystore password): {JUST PRESS RETURN}
----

* HOSTNAME : Must match content of the  "/etc/hostname or /etc/hosts" file. 

Copy the generated self-signed keystore restcomm.jks to the configuration directory as shown below

[source,lang:default,decode:true]
----
$RESTCOMM_HOME/standalone/configuration/restcomm.jks
----


[[step-3]]
Step 3 - Configure Restcomm Configuration Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[source,lang:default,decode:true]
----
$RESTCOMM_HOME/bin/restcomm/advanced.conf
----


[source,lang:default,decode:true]
----

#Allowed values FALSE, SELF, AUTH.
#If SELF set self-signed certificate will be created.
#If AUTH, Authorized certificate will be used.Need to place the certificate at "$RESTCOMM_HOME/standalone/configuration/"
#To Disable use 'FALSE'
SECURESSL=SELF

#HTTPS Settings
DISABLE_HTTP='false' #Control whether or not HTTP connector will be disabled. Values: true=HTTP connector will be disable, false=HTTP Connector will not be disabled, REDIRECT= http -> https redirection will be enabled (For CLI RestAPI requests when redirect is active https needs to be used).
TRUSTSTORE_FILE='restcomm.jks' #File should be located at $RESTCOMM_HOME/standalone/configuration folder. Provide just the name of the trustore file. Leave it blank to disable HTTPS
TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD='changeit' #Password for the trustore file
TRUSTSTORE_ALIAS='restcomm' #The certificate alias

----

If you are using a self-signed certificate, change the SSL_MODE value to SSL_MODE='allowall'
[source,lang:default,decode:true]
----
SSL_MODE='allowall' #Control whether or not Restcomm will accept self-signed certificates. Values allowall=allow self-signed certificates, strict=don't allow self signed certificates
----

Go to the Restcomm Admin UI at the following URL

[source,lang:default,decode:true]
----
https://RESTCOMM_IP_ADDRESS:8443/
----

If you want to access HTTPS using the default port 443 instead of Restcomm' default 8443, change the following options in the $RESTCOMM_HOME/bin/restcomm/restcomm.conf file.

[source,lang:default,decode:true]
----
#RestComm PORT configuration
HTTP_PORT='8080' #Port used for HTTP. Default 8080
HTTPS_PORT='8443' #Port used for HTTPS. Default 8443

----

Restcomm will now be accessible using the following URL : https://RESTCOMM_IP_ADDRESS/


[[exception-download-rcml]]
Error - Exception while trying to download RCML
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you get the above message in the Restcomm server logs when making a call with HTTPS activated, you need to modify the restcomm.conf file by updating the following parameter:

[source,lang:default,decode:true]
----
#hostname of the server to be used at restcomm.xml. If not set the STATIC_ADDRESS will be used.
RESTCOMM_HOSTNAME='YOUR_HOST_NAME'

----


The above hostname must match the one in the /etc/hosts file and must also be the same hostname in your SSL certificate.
