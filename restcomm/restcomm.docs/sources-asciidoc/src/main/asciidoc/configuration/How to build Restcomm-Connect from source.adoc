== Restcomm-Connect building

* You will need to create a script to build Restcomm-Connect.
Copy the script below into a bash script on your local directory at the root of the RestComm-Connect.
In this tutorial, the script below is stored in the file *restcomm-connect-build.sh*.

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
export RESTCOMM_HOME=/home/yuliachornobrivets/Restcomm-Connect
export MAJOR_VERSION_NUMBER=7.6
export BUILD_NUMBER=0

export WORKSPACE=$RESTCOMM_HOME
mkdir $WORKSPACE/dependencies
export DEPENDENCIES_HOME=$WORKSPACE/dependencies


ant release -f ./release/build.xml -Drestcomm.release.version=$MAJOR_VERSION_NUMBER.$BUILD_NUMBER -Drestcomm.branch.name=restcomm-release-$MAJOR_VERSION_NUMBER.$BUILD_NUMBER -Dcheckout.restcomm.dir=$RESTCOMM_HOME -Dworkspace.restcomm.dir=$RESTCOMM_HOME/restcomm -Dcheckout.dir=$DEPENDENCIES_HOME
----

* Change the restcomm-connect-build.sh permission to make it executable as follows

[source,bash]
----
chmod +x ./restcomm-connect-build.sh
----
The RestComm directory should now display the following content:

* Before running the script, give enough system resources for MAVEN as follows:
[source,bash]
----
export MAVEN_OPTS='-Xmx2048m -XX:MaxPermSize=1024m'
----

* Now, run the build script as follows:
[source,bash]
----
./restcomm-connect-build.sh
----

This may take a while to build. If the build is successful, you should see this output at the end of the build:

[source,bash]
----
make-final-zip:

    [zip] Building zip: /home/username/Restcomm-Connect/release/Restcomm-JBoss-AS7-7.6.0.zip

release:

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 42 minutes 11 seconds
----
* At the root of the RestComm directory you should see:

Note that the zip file called *Restcomm-JBoss-AS7-7.6.2* is the binary for JBoss container.
You can copy this zip file into a directory on your computer and unzip the content.
