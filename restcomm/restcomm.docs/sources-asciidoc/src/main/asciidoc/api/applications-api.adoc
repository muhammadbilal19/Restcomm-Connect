= Restcomm API – Applications

[[applications]]
== Applications

An Application instance resource represents a RCML set of instructions used by a RestComm interpreter to process an on-going call, SMS or USSD. 

RestComm stores only part of the metadata for this Application, which contains as one of its attributes the URL with the address of the application server where the RCML can be retrieved. 

Currently there are 3 types of Applications that are supported: Voice, SMS and USSD. Each type of Application will be used by its specific interpreter. 

Considering the access control executed by multi-tenancy, each Application can be created, read, updated or deleted by its owner solely. Any attempt of access to an Application using an account different than its owner will be denied.
