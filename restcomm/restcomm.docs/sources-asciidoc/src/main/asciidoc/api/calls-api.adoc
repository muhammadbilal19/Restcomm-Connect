=== Request Parameters

[cols=",",options="header",]
|==========================================================================================================================================
|Parameter |Description
|From(Required) |The phone number to use as the caller id.
|To(Required) |The phone number to call.
|Url(Required) |The fully qualified URL that should be executed when the call connects.
|Method |The HTTP method RestComm should use when making its request to the above Url. Defaults to POST.
|FallbackUrl |The URL that RestComm will request if execution of Url fails for any reason.
|FallbackMethod |The HTTP method that RestComm should use to request the FallbackUrl. Must be either GET or POST. Defaults to POST.
|statusCallbackEvent |`initiated`, `ringing`, `answered`, `completed`. Default none
|statusCallback |any url. Default none
|statusCallbackMethod |`GET`, `POST`. Default `POST`
|Timeout |The number of seconds that RestComm should allow the phone to ring before assuming there is no answer. The default is 60 seconds.
|==========================================================================================================================================

==== statusCallbackEvent

When creating a Call using the Calls API, an outbound call is initiated. The call transitions from the initiated state to the ringing state when the phone starts ringing. It transitions to the answered state when the call is picked up, and finally to the completed state when the call is over. With **statusCallbackEvent**, you can subscribe to receive webhooks for the different call progress events: initiated, ringing, answered, or completed for a given call.

The *statusCallbackEvent* attribute allows you to specify which events Restcomm should webhook on. To specify multiple events separate them with a space: initiated ringing answered completed. If a statusCallback is provided and no status callback events are specified the completed event will be sent by default.

[cols=",",options="header",]
|==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
|Event |Description
|initiated |The `initiated` event is fired when Restcomm starts dialing the call.
|ringing |The `ringing` event is fired when the call starts ringing.
|answered |The `answered` event is fired when the call is answered.
|completed |The `completed` event is fired when the call is completed regardless of the termination status: `busy`, `canceled`, `completed`, `failed`, or `no-answer`. If no `statusCallbackEvent` is specified, `completed` will be fired by default.
|==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

[[attributes-status-callback]]
==== statusCallback

The *statusCallback* attribute allows you to specify a URL for Restcomm to send webhook requests to on each event specified in the statusCallbackEvent attribute.

==== statusCallbackMethod

The *statusCallbackMethod* attribute allows you to specify which HTTP method Restcomm should use when requesting the URL in the statusCallback attribute. The default is POST.

==== Status Callback HTTP Parameters

The parameters Restcomm passes to your application in its asynchronous request to the StatusCallback URL include all parameters passed in a synchronous request to retrieve RCML when Restcomm receives a call to one of your Restcomm numbers. The full list of parameters and descriptions of each are in the RCML Voice Request documentation.

When the call progress events are fired, the Status Callback request also passes these additional parameters:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
|Parameter |Description
|CallSid |A unique identifier for this call, generated by Restcomm. You can use the `CallSid` to modify the child call by POSTing to Calls/\{CallSid} with a new RCML URL.
|CallStatus |A descriptive status for the call. The value is one of **`queued`**, **`initiated`**, **`ringing`**, **`in-progress`**, **`busy`**, **`failed`**, or **`no-answer`**. See the CallStatus section for more details.
|CallDuration |The duration in seconds of the just-completed call. Only present in the `completed` event.
//|RecordingUrl |The URL of the phone call's recorded //audio. This parameter is included only if //*`Record=true`* is set on the REST API request and //does not include recordings from `<Dial>` or //`<Record>`. *`RecordingUrl`* is only present in the //`completed` event.
//|RecordingSid |The unique ID of the Recording from //this call. `RecordingSid` is only present in the //`completed` event.
//|RecordingDuration |The duration of the recorded //audio (in seconds). `RecordingDuration` is only //present in the `completed` event.
|Timestamp |The timestamp when the event was fired, given as UTC in http://php.net/manual/en/class.datetime.php#datetime.constants.rfc2822[RFC 2822] format.
|CallbackSource |A string that describes the source of the webhook. This is provided to help disambiguate why the webhook was made. On Status Callbacks, this value is always *`call-progress-events`.*
|SequenceNumber |The order in which the events were fired, starting from `0`. Although events are fired in order, they are made as separate HTTP requests and there is no guarantee they will arrive in the same order.
|===================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

== Making a call to a SIP account

Restcomm will make a call to any SIP account that is reachable. It the example below, the *SIP* account is listening on port **5060**. When you make the call, the SIP phone on which Alice is registered will ring and the hello-play.xml file will be played.

....
curl -X POST https://ACae6e420f425248d6a26948c17a9e2acf:77f8c12cc7b8f8423e5c38b035249166@127.0.0.1:8080/restcomm/2012-04-24/Accounts/ACae6e420f425248d6a26948c17a9e2acf/Calls.json -d "From=+16175551212" -d "To=sip:alice@127.0.0.1:5060" -d "Url=http://127.0.0.1:8080/restcomm/demos/hello-play.xml"
....

== Making a call to a Restcomm client

You must first create a RestComm client. In the example below, the Restcomm client created is called Alice. When you make the call, the SIP phone on which Alice is registered will ring and the *hello-play.xml* file will be played.

....
curl -X POST https://ACae6e420f425248d6a26948c17a9e2acf:77f8c12cc7b8f8423e5c38b035249166@127.0.0.1:8080/restcomm/2012-04-24/Accounts/ACae6e420f425248d6a26948c17a9e2acf/Calls.json -d "From=+16175551212" -d "To=client:alice" -d "Url=http://127.0.0.1:8080/restcomm/demos/hello-play.xml"
....

== Calling a DID number

The above example shows how to make a call to a SIP number. If you want to make a call to a DID number, you must can connect Restcomm to a DID provisioning service provider. The quickest way is to use RestComm AMI on Amazon Cloud. Get a list of all available calls. This will return all the available calls linked to the account SID

== Working on a production server
Using filter is a good practice on a server with thousands or millions of calls

....
curl -X GET  https://administrator%40company.com:77f8c12cc7b8f8423e5c38b035249166@127.0.0.1:8080/restcomm/2012-04-24/Accounts/ACae6e420f425248d6a26948c17a9e2acf/Calls
....

If the system hasn't received any calls, you will see the the output below

[source,lang:xml,decode:true]

== Modifying Live Calls
Real time call modification allows you to interrupt an in-progress call and terminate it or have it begin processing *RCML* from a new URL. This is useful for any application where you want to asynchronously change the behavior of a running call. For example: hold music, call queues, transferring calls, forcing hangup, etc.

*Live Call Modification API is supported only for calls created with Dial verb using a RCML application*

*HTTP POST* to a Call

To redirect or terminate a live call, you make an *HTTP POST* request to an in­-progress Call instance resource URI:

*/2012­04­24/Accounts/\{AccountSid}/Calls/\{CallSid}*

or

*/2012­04­24/Accounts/\{AccountSid}/Calls.json/\{CallSid}*

The following parameters are available for you to *POST* request when modifying a phone call:

=== Request Parameters

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
|Parameter |Description
|Url |A valid URL that returns RCMLL. Restcomm will immediately redirect the call to the new RCML.
|Method |The HTTP method Restcomm should use when requesting the above URL. Defaults to POST.
|Status |Either *canceled* or completed. Specifying canceled will attempt to hangup calls that are queued or ringing but not affect calls already in progress. Specifying completed will attempt to hang up a call even if it's already in progress.
| Mute | Either *true* or *flase*. Setting value of this parameter to *true* will mute the call. Setting value of this parameter to *false* will unmute the call.
|===================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

=== Call in-Progress

Note that any call which is currently ringing within a Dial verb is in-progress from the point of view of Restcomm, and thus you must use '**Status=completed**' to cancel it.

==== Optional Parameters

You may *POST* the following parameters:

==== Request Parameters

[cols=",",options="header",]
|==================================================================================================================================
|Parameter |Description
|FallbackUrl |A URL that Restcomm will request if an error occurs requesting or executing the RCMLL at Url.
|FallbackMethod |The HTTP method that Restcomm should use to request the FallbackUrl. Must be either GET or POST. Defaults to POST.
|StatusCallback |A URL that Restcomm will request when the call ends to notify your app.
|StatusCallbackMethod |The HTTP method Restcomm should use when requesting the above URL. Defaults to POST.
|MoveConnectedCallLeg |If True, Restcomm will move both call legs to the new URL
|==================================================================================================================================

=== Description

Prerequisite for the Live Call Modification API is to know the *CallSid* ​of the call. The **CallSid**​ is generated by Restcomm for every incoming or outgoing call. When we create an outgoing call using the Calls REST API, Restcomm will generate the **CallSid** ​and the response will contain the **CallSid**​. For an Incoming call, Restcomm will generate the **CallSid**​, and will include it in the parameters of the *GET* or *POST* request to download the RCML from the application server. So the application server, will get the *CallSid* ​for this incoming call and can store it for later use.

[[steps-for-an-incoming-call-are-the-following]]
==== Steps for an incoming call are the following:

* New incoming call to Restcomm
* Restcomm generates CallSid and other parameters for this call
* Restcomm prepares GET/POST request and attaches the previously prepared parameters
* Restcomm sends the GET/POST request to the URL assigned to the DID called
* Application server receives the GET/POST request
* Application server should store the CallSid along with the rest of the parameters for later use
* Application server prepares the response with the appropriate RCML for the given DID and send it back to Restcomm to process it

Given that we have the *CallSid* ​available, ​the next step to modify a live call is to prepare the new *POST* request to Restcomm with the URL of the new destination application.

Lets assume that initially the Application server prepared an RCML that will connect the incoming call to Bob and that later Bob wants this call to be transferred to Alice. Application Server will have to prepare a new RCML that will dial to Alice, and using the Live Call Modification API, will ask Restcomm to process this new RCML for the incoming call and thus will connect it to Alice.

Here are the steps:

* Incoming call -­ CallSid (1234567890)
* Applcation server: - Store CallSid and other parameters - Prepare and send RCML that connects the call to Bob (using Dial verb)
* Restcomm process the given RCML and connects incoming call to Bob
* Bob wants to transfer the call to Alice and sends the request to Controller (application server)
* Application server: - Prepares new RCML with a given URL: http://app.server/CallToAlice that using Dial will dial to Alice - Uses Live Call Modification prepares a new POST request: http://RESTCOMM_IP:8080/restcomm/2012­04­24/Accounts/\{AccountSid/Calls/YOUR_CALL_SID - in the POST requests adds the following parameters: Url=http://app.server/CallToAlice
* Restcomm process this Live Call Modification request and redirects the incoming call to the new RCML application (to the new URL)
* Eventually the incoming call will be connected to Alice.

Similar, application server can change an incoming call to Bob to a conference call where more participants can be added later. Given that application server already knows the CallSid for the incoming call to Bob

* Will prepare a new RCML for the Dial Conference
* Will prepare new POST Live Call Modification request for the incoming call to be connected to the new url (that will dial to the conference)
* Will then prepare new outgoing call request, using the Calls Rest API that will connect Bob to the conference application URL: - http://RESTCOMM_IP:8080/restcomm/2012­04­24/Accounts/\{AccountSid}/Calls - will pass the following parameters: **From**=INCOMING_CALL_ID **To**=client:bob **Url**=CONFERENCE_APPLICATION_URL
* Later application server can create more outgoing call requests, similar to the one above, to invite other clients or sip URLs or PSTN numbers to this conference call
