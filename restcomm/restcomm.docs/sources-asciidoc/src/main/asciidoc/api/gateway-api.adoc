= Restcomm API – Gateways

[[gateways]]
== Gateways

The Gateways subresources let you create sip accounts that Restcomm will use to register itself to the Gateway and receive incoming traffic. This feature is similar to when a SIP phone registers to a Proxy Server and receives inbound calls/messages. In this cases, Restcomm will act as the SIP client initiating the register connection to the Proxy Server.
